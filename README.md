# foundry-data-collection
Part of my Cooper Union ME360 Engineering Experimentation
Our project was a custom metal foundry with temperature sensors embedded in different locations to perform heat transfer analysis
These scripts read the temperature data and upload it to CSV
[The Arduino script was run on an Arduino Uno connected to the sensors. This script read and displayed the temperature of each sensor]: # 
[The Python script read these temperatures from Serial and uploaded them to a CSV file]: #
